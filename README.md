## Introduction

This project contains some experiments using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

It is based on **Python 3.6** and utilizes **CUDA GPU** support, prerequisites are described on https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu.

The project is not tailored towards any specific IDE, although I personally used **Visual Studio Code** with its **Python** plugin.

Simply run the appropriate python file from the **tensorflow_playground** subdirectory.
